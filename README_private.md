## Peer Reviews about my performance

* Iteration 1:
  * [STUDENT A]: 
I appreciate how you still offer to help the team even though you already finished your assigned work. From what i saw, code was very clean. If i had to think of a negative, it would be to code review more diligently.

  * [STUDENT B]: 
Good work maintaining code quality and completing tasks early.
Although not the repo manager anymore, do try and assist others in performing code reviews.

  * [STUDENT C]: 
Helpful and involved in any concerns raised. Kept track of and managed GitLab use well.


* Iteration 2:

  * [STUDENT A]: 
i appreciate how you very diligently tested the code near the end of the iteration. Worked very well on your own and most code had very few bugs. I believe you could improve your code by increasing the spacing of your parameters because it is sometimes hard to read ex: in the array adapters

  * [STUDENT B]: 
Good work setting up the code for composing messages to other users. Finished coding in a timely manner, allowing for the team to work with the other aspects related to messaging.

  * [STUDENT C]: 
Helpful in discussing implementation issues. Effective in testing features to find and eliminate bugs.

* Iteration 3:
  * [STUDENT A]: 
again, i appreciate how you found bugs in application. Very diligent in your bug detection. I believe your code quality could be improved by adding more comments and spaces to be more readable.

  * [STUDENT B]: 
Completed assigned tasks promptly, and carefully reviewed code for quality and consistency over the course of all of the iterations. Identified errors or bugs in code early and provided solutions for other team members, allowing for a seamless process. Made sure to verify and clarify requirements to ensure all tasks were being met. Attended all meetings. Pleasure working with you.

  * [STUDENT C]: 
Great contribution to ideas for implementing features. Looked out for issues and offered assistance without being asked.
