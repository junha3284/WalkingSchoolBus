## Peer Reviews about my performance

Iteration 1:

[STUDENT A]: 
I appreciate how you still offer to help the team even though you already finished your assigned work. From what i saw, code was very clean. If i had to think of a negative, it would be to code review more diligently.

[STUDENT B]: 
Good work maintaining code quality and completing tasks early.
Although not the repo manager anymore, do try and assist others in performing code reviews.

[STUDENT C]: 
Helpful and involved in any concerns raised. Kept track of and managed GitLab use well.


Iteration 2:

[STUDENT A]: 
i appreciate how you very diligently tested the code near the end of the iteration. Worked very well on your own and most code had very few bugs. I believe you could improve your code by increasing the spacing of your parameters because it is sometimes hard to read ex: in the array adapters

[STUDENT B]: 
Good work setting up the code for composing messages to other users. Finished coding in a timely manner, allowing for the team to work with the other aspects related to messaging.

[STUDENT C]: 
Helpful in discussing implementation issues. Effective in testing features to find and eliminate bugs.
